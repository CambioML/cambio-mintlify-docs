## Overview
The `AnyParser` API has asynchronous endpoints for its parsing and extraction features. These are asynchronous endpoints that will return a file ID. You can use this file ID to fetch the results of the extraction at a later time. Consider using if you have longer or more complex files. These async endpoints have a timeout of 180 seconds.

There are 2 async endpoints:
| Endpoint        | Description                                       |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| [/async/upload](/api-reference/endpoint/upload)      | Upload the file to process and the process type. Returns the file ID. |
| [/async/fetch](/api-reference/endpoint/fetch)  | Poll the results for a file ID.     |

Generally, for all async requests, you would upload a file via the `/async/upload` endpoint, get its file_id, and then poll the `/async/fetch` endpoint to get the result.

## /async/upload
This endpoint is used to upload a file with a specified `process_type` and get a file ID.

You can specify the following for the `process_type`:
| process_type        | Description                                       |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `file` | This is the Default. It parses the full content from a file. This has the same functionality as the [full-content-parse](/sdk-reference/full-content-parse) in the SDK |
| `json` | This extracts key-value pairs from the document. This has the same functionality as the [key-value extraction](/sdk-reference/key-value-extraction) in the SDK |

For more details on how to call this endpoint see the [Async Upload Endpoint Example](/api-reference/endpoint/async-upload).

## /async/fetch
Once you have retrieved the `file_id` from the `/async/upload` endpoint, you then send that `file_id` to the `/async/fetch` endpoint to retrieve the result.

For more details on how to call this endpoint see the [Async Upload Endpoint Example](/api-reference/endpoint/async-fetch).
