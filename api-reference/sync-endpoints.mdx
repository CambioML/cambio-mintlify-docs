## Overview
The `AnyParser` API has synchronous endpoints for its parsing and extraction features. These are a blocking and will return the results of the parse or extraction. It will time out after 30 seconds. This works well for shorter and simple files.

Here's an overview of the endpoints:
| Endpoint        | Description                                       |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| [/parse](/api-reference/endpoint/parse)      | Parses the entire content of a file into markdown |
| [/extract_pii](/api-reference/endpoint/extract_pii)  | Extracts Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from a file        |
| [/extract_tables](/api-reference/endpoint/extract_tables)  | Extracts tables from a file        |
| [/extract_key_value](/api-reference/endpoint/extract_key_value)  | Extracts key-value information from a file        |
| [/extract_resume_key_value](/api-reference/endpoint/extract_resume_key_value)  | Extracts candidate's information from a resume        |
| [/query](/api-reference/endpoint/query)  | Query to see how many pages you have left for your api key      |
