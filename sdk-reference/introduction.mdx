## Overview

The `AnyParser` is a real-time parser designed to extract content from various file formats. It's easiest to get started using the [AnyParser SDK](https://pypi.org/project/any-parser/).

### File formats
The SDK processes the following types of files:
- **PDF files**
- **Office files**: `docx`, `pptx`
- **Image files**: `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`

### Features
The SDK has the following features:
- Full content parsing
- Key-value extraction
- Tables extraction

### Sync vs Async API
- **Sync API**: This is a blocking API that will return the results of the extraction. It will time out after 30 seconds.

- **Async API**: This is an asynchronous API that will return a file ID. You can use this file ID to fetch the results of the extraction at a later time.

### API
If you'd prefer to call the RESTful API directly, please refer to the [API Reference](/api-reference/)
